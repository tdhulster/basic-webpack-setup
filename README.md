# basic-webpack-setup
A basic webpack setup.

Initially made for a colleague who wanted to start quickly but couldn't figure out what tools he would use (Grunt, gulp, bower, livereload, ...)

We'll see where this goes.

## How to use
Run the following npm run commands to start:
    "watch": "webpack --progress --watch" // start continuous incremental builds in development
    "start": "webpack-dev-server --open"  // start development server
    "build": "webpack"                    // build once

Future :
- [ ] SCSS
- [ ] React
- [ ] Typescript
